            My name is Mohamed Nya, born and raised in Morocco. My birthday is on the 18th of March. I enjoy cooking and making new friends.
            
            I am also passionate about technology, travel, and learning new languages. I can speak four languages fluently which are, Amazigh, Arabic, French, and English, and I am currently learning Spanish, I spent 3 months learning Spanish in Mexico, and I am planning to go back to perfect it.
            
            I value freedom and independence, which is why my goal in life is to have my own business and travel the world, I grew up in the desert, so I absolutely hate cold weather. Thatâ€™s why one day I would love to leave car-dependent North America and move somewhere warm that has infrastructure that is designed to accommodate human beings.
